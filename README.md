Automatic scroller for most web pages. Simply enter the desired speed, 1-10, and hit go. Pause or adjust speed at any time!

TODO:
- Add pdf support
- Change url matching to documented <all_urls>
- Check for non-window scrolls
- Reduce speed conversion fractions for smoother scroll
- Remove extraneous imports (unused glyphs, etc)
- Clean up folder organization (and references in files)
